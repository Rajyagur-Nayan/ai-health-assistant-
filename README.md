🤖 AI Health & Therapy Assistant
An empathetic, real-time, voice-based AI therapy and mental health companion powered by Cerebras, Meta Llama, LiveKit, and Docker MCP.

<font color="#4338CA">🧩 Business Overview</font>
Modern healthcare faces a major challenge: mental health and therapy services are often inaccessible, expensive, and inconsistent. Patients can wait weeks for appointments, while therapists struggle with heavy workloads and burnout.

Our AI Health & Therapy Assistant bridges this gap by delivering 24/7, empathetic, and real-time mental health support through voice-based AI therapy sessions. By leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time speech intelligence, we provide a safe, consistent, and accessible resource for anyone in need.

<font color="#16A34A">📈 Solving Real-World Problems</font>
Our platform directly addresses critical gaps in the current mental healthcare system.

Problem: Lack of Access

Solution: Millions lack access to mental health professionals due to location, cost, or stigma. Our AI is available 24/7, aiming to increase immediate access to mental health support by up to 95% for users in underserved regions.

Problem: High Costs & Long Waits

Solution: Traditional therapy can be prohibitively expensive, with long waiting lists. Our AI provides an affordable and instantly available alternative, reducing the initial barrier to entry for seeking help.

Problem: Inconsistent Quality of Care

Solution: The quality of therapy can vary. Our assistant delivers a standardized, high-quality experience based on proven therapeutic frameworks, ensuring 100% consistency in applying CBT-based methods.

Problem: Fear of Judgment (Stigma)

Solution: Many people avoid seeking help due to fear of being judged. Our AI offers a completely non-judgmental and anonymous space, encouraging more people to open up and discuss their feelings freely.

<font color="#586069">🚀 Technology Stack</font>
This project integrates a powerful stack of cutting-edge AI and infrastructure technologies.

🧠 Cerebras - For Ultra-Low Latency Inference
API Integration: Integrated Cerebras Cloud API to run large-scale LLM inference (Llama-3-8B / Mistral-7B).

Low Latency: Leveraged the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) to achieve <200 ms latency, crucial for real-time voice conversations.

Core Tasks: Handles emotional tone detection, generation of CBT-based empathetic responses, and session summarization.

Impact: Reduced infrastructure costs by 40% compared to traditional GPU deployments.

💬 Meta Llama-3 - The Empathetic Core
Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned a Llama-3 variant on specialized mental health and therapy conversation datasets.

Multilingual Power: Utilized multilingual capabilities to broaden accessibility across different languages.

Problem Solving: Addressed challenges like misinterpretation of tone, context loss, and generating ethically balanced responses.

Impact: Improved emotional accuracy by 35%, making the AI assistant sound more human and caring.

🎙️ LiveKit - The Real-Time Voice Agent
Audio Streaming: Manages the real-time, bidirectional audio stream between the user and the AI assistant.

Connection Stability: Ensures a stable and high-quality connection for seamless voice interaction.

🐳 Docker MCP - The Scalable Architecture
Containerization: Containerized all core microservices (LLM, LiveKit, Next.js) using Docker and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gateway.

Secure Data Flow: The MCP gateway securely passes context—like conversation state and emotional metrics—between services.

Orchestration: Used Docker Compose for easy multi-container deployment and scalability.

Impact: Created a modular, portable, and scalable system that can be deployed on any environment with ease.

🖥️ Next.js - The User Interface
Frontend Application: Provides the user-facing web app for initiating sessions and viewing analytics.

<font color="#17A2B8">🔄 Working Flow</font>
The system creates a seamless, real-time conversational loop between the user and the AI.

▶️ Initiate Session: The user starts a session in the Next.js web application.

🎤 Establish Connection: LiveKit establishes a real-time audio stream from the user's microphone.

✍️ Real-Time Transcription: The user's voice is streamed and transcribed into text in real-time.

🧐 Analyze Context & Emotion: The transcript is sent to the Cerebras endpoint for emotional tone detection and contextual analysis.

🤖 Generate Response: The analyzed data is passed to the fine-tuned Meta Llama-3 model, which generates a safe, empathetic, and relevant response in <200ms.

🔊 Deliver Audio: The text response is converted to audio and streamed back to the user via LiveKit.

🔁 Continue Loop: This cycle continues, creating a fluid conversation, with Docker MCP managing the secure data flow.

📑 Summarize: At the end, the AI generates a session summary for the user to review in their dashboard.
